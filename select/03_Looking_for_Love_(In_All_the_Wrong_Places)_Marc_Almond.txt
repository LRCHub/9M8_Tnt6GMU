Keep on looking now
You gotta keep on looking now
Keep on looking now

You're looking for love
In all the wrong places

Where your walk it's always shadow
Conversation always shallow
When they talk they never look you in the eye
They look over your shoulder
To faces even colder
And you feel a little older
Every time

You're looking for love
In all the wrong places

When you're looking for reaction
When you're searching for direction
When you're scared of rejection
Or attack
You need the warmth of loving
When you're growing tired of seeing
A colourless reflection
Looking back

You're looking for love
In all the wrong places

Something real to fill those little empty spaces
So you're looking for love in all the wrong places

You need understanding
You need a home
All those people so alone
You need understanding
You need a home
All those people so alone

You're looking for love
In all the wrong places
You're looking for love
In all the wrong places

You better keep on looking now!

And so the evening shade will fall
Where nameless voices call and call
And think of all the friends you made
While you toast with Prozac and lemonade

You can hold me under septic skies
(You can dream to your own places)
Watch the sun set in my eyes
(You can't seem to put)
Could this be the time to die?
(A name to all the faces)
The wind upon your face
(Something real)
Your lips upon my lips
Like urban velvet
(To fill those little empty spaces)

So you're looking for love in all the wrong places
You keep on looking for love in all the wrong places

Dream and take away the tears
(Keep on looking now)
Drift on to where your heart is numb
(You gotta keep on looking now)
It's lovely there where love becomes
A drug to fill your need
Just believe in you!
And learn to love yourself
Before anyone else
